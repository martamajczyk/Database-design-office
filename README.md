## General info about the database project
The company offers comprehensive residential and commercial interior design services and cooperates with investors throughout Poland. 
Company data came from various sources and was collected using several tools, which made it difficult to analyze it and, consequently, to draw business conclusions. 
Thanks to the database implementation:
* data will be organized and collected in one place,
* data will be able to be analyzed effectively,
* based on the analyzes performed, it will be possible to make informed
business decisions.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* PostgreSQL 
* Microsoft Excel (+ Power Query and Power Pivot), .xlsx and .csv files
* Clockify App, .xlsx and .csv files

## Sources
This project is inspired by my own experience as an architect. 
Having worked as an employee in various design offices, I observed many business and organizational challenges they faced.
	
## Setup
There is a database backup file in the repository, and I have also shared files for 'Tables' and 'Constraints' to illustrate my thought process.
